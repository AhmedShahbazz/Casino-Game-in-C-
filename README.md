Casino Number Guessing Game in C++

## Project Overview

The Casino Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive console-based game developed in C++. In this game, the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Each guess provides feedback to help the player zero in on the correct number. The objective is to guess the correct number with as few attempts as possible. This project is great for beginners who are learning C++ and want to explore concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and basic input/output.

## Features

Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number at the start of each play session, ensuring that each game is unique.
Guess Feedback: After each guess, the game informs the player if the actual number is higher or lower than the guess, helping the player to make more informed guesses.
Guess Counting: The game keeps track of the number of guesses made, and displays this count once the correct number is guessed.
User Input Validation: The game includes error handling to ensure that invalid inputs (such as non-numeric input) are managed gracefully.
Replayability: After guessing the correct number, players are given the option to play again, restarting the game loop without needing to restart the program.

## How to Play

Start the Game: Run the executable file.
Enter Your Guess: Type a number in the console and press Enter.
Receive Feedback and Adjust Your Guess: Based on the feedback ("higher" or "lower"), make your next guess.
Repeat: Continue guessing until you find the correct number.
Play Again: Once you guess correctly, you can choose to play another round or exit the game.

# Language Used: C++
